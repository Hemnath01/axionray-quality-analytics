AxionRay Quality Analytics
Data analysis project for AxionRay's engineering quality data, focusing on validation, cleaning, and insights generation using Python. This project leverages data analysis techniques to improve product quality and safety through AI-driven solutions.

Project Overview
This project consists of three main tasks:

Task 1: Data Validation and Cleaning
Column-wise analysis of the dataset
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Critical column identification
Tag generation from free text fields
Key insights and recommendations


Task 2: Data Preparation and Integration
Primary key identification
Data cleaning and standardization
Dataset integration
Join strategy implementation


Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trend analysis with visualizations
Root cause identification
Component failure analysis
Stakeholder insights generation
